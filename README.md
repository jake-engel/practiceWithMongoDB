# practiceWithMongoDB
This repository includes 4 apps, one of them is hosted on the following link. NOTE: only wrote mongoDB queries for the project on production.

UpStar Music: Basic CRUD App dealing with music artists. Only wrote mongoDB queries for this app, rest was gotten elsewhere.

Muber: More MongoDB practice. This time however also got to use geospatial queries to practice finding nearby drivers using google maps.

Promises-Refresh: Basic app to help refresh memory on JavaScript Promises. 

Users: Another basic MongoDB CRUD app dealing with blog posts and comments.
